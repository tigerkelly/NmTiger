The NmTiger program is a network monitoring tool that shows network traffic in
either Kilobits, Kilobytes, Megabits or Megabytes.

This program only monitors the interface selected and only the traffic destined
for that interface, so if you want to monitor an interface on another system
then you need to run this program on that system.

Some features are:
	- Dynamically change to Kilobits, Kilobytes, Megabits or Megabytes.
	- Take snapshots of the current chart.
	- Shows both TCP and UDP packet counts.
	- Shows packet counts for all packet types, using the 'Stats' button.
	- Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
	
Selecting an interface starts the network monitoring, use the 'Stop' button to
stop monitoring.

The 'Stats' button show the current packets counts for all type of packets.

I did not include packet detailing because I think Wireshark does that best.

I hope to find this program useful.
