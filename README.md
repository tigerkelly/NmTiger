## Some features are:

	- Dynamically change to Kilobits, Kilobytes, Megabits or Megabytes.
	- Take snapshots of the current chart.

	- Shows packet counts for all packet types, using the 'Stats' button.

## Requirement:
The Pcap driver must be loaded on the system this runs on. [Winpcap](https://www.winpcap.org/install/).

For **Linux** and **Mac** you will need libpcap installed, just search google for instructions.
